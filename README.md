# Blindfolded-Trainer

*I based blindfolded solves off of the Old Pochmann Method (I'm too lazy to learn 3-style or Orozco)

Blindfolded solving of a cube involves memorizing a sequence of letters that are attributed to the different pieces. The specifics on how the Old Pochmann buffer locations and solution work for a 3x3 can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ41gWvltT8) from my goat JPerm.

The WCA currently only counts 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 BLD as official comps so those will be my classes.

Piece attribution for 3x3:
- 12 Edges, 24 edge faces memorized from A to Z
- 8 Corners, 24 corner faces memorized from A to Z

Piece attribution for 4x4:
**To be learned and explained**

Piece attribution for 5x5:
**To be learned and explained**

# Class Hierarchy
* Cube
  * 3x3
  * 4x4 (to be learned and implemented I can barely speed solve a 4x4 with my eyes open)
  * 5x5 (same as above)
